## Overview

### The challenge

I challenged myself to make a twitter clone after a video popped up about clone apps. I knew a project like this would help develop my front-end development skills. To make the project more challenging, I didn't use any resources except for when I would run into errors in which I used Google/StackOverflow to solve.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Firebase
- Routers
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- NodeJS
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned how to develop a twitter style layout which involved three columns, two of which scroll. Developing this project, I gained more confidence and skills in react. I am a lot more comfortable with jsx, state, and firebase because of this twitter clone. For a few days I was struggling to render tweet components using .map() buit I eventually got it to work. After working on this project, I can honestly say I came out a better developer.

### Continued development

I had tried using the twitter API to pull tweets for the feed but I couldn't get it to work efficently enough. In my next project, I want to for sure use an API and connect to it using some sort of authentication like an APIKEY or Bearer token.
